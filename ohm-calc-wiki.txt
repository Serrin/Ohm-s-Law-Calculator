Voltage (V) calculation from current (I) and resistance (R):

V(V) = I(A) × R(Ω)

Complex power (S) calculation from voltage (V) and current (I):

P(W) = V(V) × I(A) = V 2(V) / R(Ω) = I 2(A) × R(Ω)


Ohm's Law defines the relationship between power, voltage, current, and resistance. The various possible formulas for Ohm's law are as follows.

Where
P = power in watts
E = voltage in volts
I = current in amps
R = resistance in ohms

P = E2/R
P = I2 * R
P = E * I

E = sqrt(P * R)
E = P/I
E = I * R

I = E/R
I = P/E
I = sqrt(P/R)

R = E/I
R = E2/P
R = P/I2
